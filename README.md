# SybilGovernance
Experimental Sybil Identification Method using Graph Deep Learning

# Metagov/Gitcoin Proposal
This proposal requests funding for the next phase of an innovative project aimed at advancing and sharing a deep learning-based method for detecting sybils in Web3 governance voting. Initially funded by York University for one year, this project has successfully led to the creation of a unique method for sybil identification. While sybils, or fabricated identities, support user privacy they come at the cost of obscuring true voting patterns, which frustrates attempts at decentralized, polycentric governance.

The current stage of research focuses on refining, scaling, and validating the technique, with an emphasis on making it robust, reliable, and practically useful. Additionally, the project seeks to engage with and gather insights from Metagov, Web3, and academic communities. This feedback will be crucial for further improvement and ensuring the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. The end goal is to open-source this refined method, contributing a valuable tool to the field of decentralized governance.
